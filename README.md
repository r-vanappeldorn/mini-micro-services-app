# mini micro sevices app

**Disclaimer!**

This is just a project to learn the fundamentals of micro services. I wouldn't recommend using the backend logic in a real project.

# Getting started

Install docker, kubernetes and skaffold on your device. Then edit your `/etc/hosts` file and add the following line `127.0.0.1 mini-app.io`. Then run `skaffold dev` and the application should run on http://mini-app.io
